### ðŸ”§ **What You Need to Do Next**

Since I cannot install Android Studio or generate APKs in this environment, you'll need to complete the build process on your local machine:

### **STEP 1: Download the Project**
1. Copy the entire `/app/frontend` folder to your local machine
2. Ensure all files are present, including the `android/` directory

### **STEP 2: Install Prerequisites**
- **Android Studio**: Download from https://developer.android.com/studio
- **Java JDK 11+**: Usually included with Android Studio
- **Set ANDROID_HOME**: Point to your Android SDK directory

### **STEP 3: Build the APK**
Choose one of these methods:

#### **Method A: Automated Script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd your-frontend-folder
./build-apk.sh
```
The script will guide you through the build options.

#### **Method B: Manual Build**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn install

# Build web assets
npm run build  # or yarn build

# Sync Capacitor
npx cap sync android

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

#### **Method C: Command Line Only**
```bash
# For debug APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# For release APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```
